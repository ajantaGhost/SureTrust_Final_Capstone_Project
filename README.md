## Project Overview

The **Hotel Booking Intelligence Pipeline** is an **end-to-end data analytics and data science project** that transforms raw hotel booking data into **meaningful insights and predictive intelligence**.

The project integrates **Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI** to analyze booking behavior, cancellation patterns, customer trends, and revenue performance. The final outcome supports **data-driven decision-making** for hotel management.

---

## Project Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw hotel booking data  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Identify key factors influencing booking cancellations  
- Build machine learning models to predict booking status  
- Analyze revenue and customer behavior  
- Create interactive dashboards for business decision-making  
- Demonstrate a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow  

---

## Problem Statement

Hotels often struggle with high cancellation rates, uneven occupancy, and revenue loss. Manual analysis of booking data is inefficient and error-prone.

This project solves the problem by building an **automated intelligence pipeline** that predicts cancellations, highlights high-value bookings, and provides actionable insights through dashboards.

## Work Done Using Excel

Excel was used in the **initial data preparation phase**:
- Removed duplicate records and handled missing values  
- Corrected data types and standardized formats  
- Created derived columns such as:
  - Stay Duration  
  - Total Revenue  
- Used filters, pivot tables, and formulas for preliminary analysis  
- Prepared clean datasets for further processing in SQL and Python  

---

## Work Done Using SQL

SQL was used for **structured data storage and analysis**:
- Stored cleaned data in relational tables  
- Wrote SQL queries for:
  - Aggregations (revenue, cancellations)  
  - Filtering by hotel type, room type, and booking status  
- Enabled efficient querying for trend analysis and reporting  

---

## Work Done Using Python

Python was used for **data analysis and machine learning**:
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas  
- Visualized trends and patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- Engineered features for modeling  
- Built machine learning models:
  - Random Forest for cancellation prediction  
  - Linear Regression for revenue analysis  
- Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics  

---

## Work Done Using Power BI

Power BI was used for **interactive visualization and reporting**:
- Built dynamic dashboards to monitor key KPIs  
- Created charts for:
  - Booking trends  
  - Cancellation rates  
  - Revenue by room type and hotel category  
- Implemented slicers for:
  - Hotel type  
  - Room type  
  - Market segment  
- Enabled business users to explore insights easily
